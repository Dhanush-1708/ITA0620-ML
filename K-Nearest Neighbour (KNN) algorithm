Aim

To implement the K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) algorithm and classify a new data point based on the nearest neighbors.

Algorithm

Read the training dataset with features and class labels.

Choose the value of K (number of neighbors).

Calculate the distance between test data and all training samples.

Sort distances in ascending order.

Select the first K nearest neighbors.

Assign the class based on majority voting.

Python Code
# K-Nearest Neighbour Algorithm

from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
import numpy as np

# Training data (feature and label)
X_train = [
    [2, 4],
    [4, 6],
    [4, 4],
    [6, 4],
    [6, 6]
]

Y_train = ['A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'B']

# Convert data to NumPy array
X_train = np.array(X_train)

# Create KNN classifier
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)

# Train the model
knn.fit(X_train, Y_train)

# Test data
X_test = [[5, 5]]

# Predict class
prediction = knn.predict(X_test)

print("Test Data:", X_test)
print("Predicted Class:", prediction)

Output
Test Data: [[5, 5]]
Predicted Class: ['B']

Result

Thus, the K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm was successfully implemented and the given test data was classified correctly.
