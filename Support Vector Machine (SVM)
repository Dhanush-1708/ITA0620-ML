Aim

To implement the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for binary classification and classify a new data point.

Algorithm

Prepare the training dataset with features and class labels.

Import the required libraries.

Create an SVM classifier with a suitable kernel.

Train the classifier using the training data.

Test the model using new input data.

Display the predicted class.

Python Code
# Support Vector Machine (SVM) Implementation

import numpy as np
from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Training data (features)
X_train = [
    [1, 2],
    [2, 3],
    [3, 3],
    [6, 5],
    [7, 7],
    [8, 6]
]

# Class labels
Y_train = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]

# Convert to NumPy array
X_train = np.array(X_train)
Y_train = np.array(Y_train)

# Create SVM model
model = SVC(kernel='linear')

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, Y_train)

# Test data
X_test = [[5, 4]]

# Predict class
prediction = model.predict(X_test)

print("Test Data:", X_test)
print("Predicted Class:", prediction)

Output
Test Data: [[5, 4]]
Predicted Class: [1]

Result

Thus, the Support Vector Machine algorithm was successfully implemented and the given test data was classified correctly.
