Aim

To implement the K-Means clustering algorithm and group data points into clusters based on similarity.

Algorithm

Choose the number of clusters K.

Initialize K centroids randomly.

Assign each data point to the nearest centroid using distance measure.

Recalculate centroids as the mean of assigned points.

Repeat steps 3 and 4 until centroids do not change.

Display the clustered data using a graph.

Python Code
# K-Means Clustering Implementation

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Create dataset
X = np.array([
    [1, 2],
    [1, 4],
    [1, 0],
    [4, 2],
    [4, 4],
    [4, 0]
])

# Create K-Means model
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2, random_state=0)

# Train model
kmeans.fit(X)

# Get cluster labels and centroids
labels = kmeans.labels_
centroids = kmeans.cluster_centers_

print("Cluster Labels:", labels)
print("Centroids:\n", centroids)

# Plot clusters
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=labels)
plt.scatter(centroids[:, 0], centroids[:, 1], marker='X')
plt.xlabel("X-axis")
plt.ylabel("Y-axis")
plt.title("K-Means Clustering")
plt.show()

Output
Cluster Labels: [1 1 1 0 0 0]
Centroids:
 [[4. 2.]
  [1. 2.]]


(Graph shows two clearly separated clusters with centroids)

Result

Thus, the K-Means clustering algorithm was successfully implemented and the data points were grouped into two clusters.
