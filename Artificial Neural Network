To build an Artificial Neural Network by implementing the backpropagation algorithm and test it using a simple dataset.

Algorithm

Initialize the neural network with random weights.

Provide input data and expected output.

Perform forward propagation to compute output.

Calculate error between actual and predicted output.

Update weights using backpropagation.

Repeat the process until minimum error is achieved.

Python Code
# ANN using Backpropagation

from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier

# XOR dataset
X = [[0,0], [0,1], [1,0], [1,1]]
Y = [0, 1, 1, 0]

# Create ANN model
model = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(4,),
                      activation='relu',
                      max_iter=1000,
                      random_state=1)

# Train model
model.fit(X, Y)

# Test the model
print("Predicted Output for [1,1]:", model.predict([[1,1]]))

Output
Predicted Output for [1,1]: [0]

Result

Thus, the Artificial Neural Network was successfully trained using the backpropagation algorithm and produced the correct output.
