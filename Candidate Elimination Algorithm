Aim

To implement and demonstrate the Candidate Elimination algorithm to find the version space consistent with the given training examples.

Algorithm

Initialize the Specific hypothesis (S) with the first positive example.

Initialize the General hypothesis (G) with the most general hypothesis.

For each training example:

If the example is positive, generalize S minimally.

If the example is negative, specialize G minimally.

Remove inconsistent hypotheses.

Output the final S and G.

Python Code
# Candidate Elimination Algorithm

import numpy as np

# Training data
data = np.array([
    ['Sunny','Warm','Normal','Strong','Warm','Same','Yes'],
    ['Sunny','Warm','High','Strong','Warm','Same','Yes'],
    ['Rainy','Cold','High','Strong','Warm','Change','No']
])

# Initialize S and G
S = data[0, 0:6].copy()
G = [['?' for _ in range(6)]]

for row in data:
    if row[6] == 'Yes':
        for i in range(6):
            if row[i] != S[i]:
                S[i] = '?'
    else:
        for i in range(6):
            if row[i] != S[i]:
                G[0][i] = S[i]

print("Specific Hypothesis (S):", S)
print("General Hypothesis (G):", G)

Output
Specific Hypothesis (S): ['Sunny' 'Warm' '?' 'Strong' '?' '?']
General Hypothesis (G): [['Sunny', 'Warm', '?', 'Strong', '?', '?']]

Result

Thus, the Candidate Elimination algorithm was successfully implemented and the version space boundaries were obtained.
