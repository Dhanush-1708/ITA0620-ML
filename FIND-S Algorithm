Aim

To implement and demonstrate the FIND-S algorithm for finding the most specific hypothesis based on a given set of training data samples.

Algorithm

Initialize the hypothesis with the first positive training example.

For each training example in the dataset:

If the example is positive, compare it with the hypothesis.

Replace differing attribute values with ?.

Ignore negative examples.

The final hypothesis obtained is the most specific hypothesis.

Python Code
# FIND-S Algorithm Implementation

import pandas as pd

# Training data
data = pd.DataFrame([
    ['Sunny','Warm','Normal','Strong','Warm','Same','Yes'],
    ['Sunny','Warm','High','Strong','Warm','Same','Yes'],
    ['Rainy','Cold','High','Strong','Warm','Change','No'],
    ['Sunny','Warm','High','Strong','Cool','Change','Yes']
])

# Initialize hypothesis
hypothesis = ['0'] * 6

# Apply FIND-S algorithm
for i in range(len(data)):
    if data.iloc[i, 6] == 'Yes':
        if hypothesis == ['0'] * 6:
            hypothesis = list(data.iloc[i, 0:6])
        else:
            for j in range(6):
                if hypothesis[j] != data.iloc[i, j]:
                    hypothesis[j] = '?'

print("Final Hypothesis:", hypothesis)

Output
Final Hypothesis: ['Sunny', 'Warm', '?', 'Strong', '?', '?']

Result

Thus, the FIND-S algorithm was successfully implemented and the most specific hypothesis was obtained from the given training data.
