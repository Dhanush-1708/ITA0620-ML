Aim

To implement Hierarchical Clustering and visualize the clustering process using a dendrogram.

Algorithm

Collect the dataset.

Compute distance between data points.

Merge the closest clusters step by step.

Continue merging until all points form a single cluster.

Plot the dendrogram to visualize hierarchy.

Python Code
# Hierarchical Clustering Implementation

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import dendrogram, linkage

# Dataset
X = np.array([
    [1, 2],
    [2, 3],
    [3, 4],
    [5, 6],
    [6, 7],
    [7, 8]
])

# Perform hierarchical clustering
linked = linkage(X, method='ward')

# Plot dendrogram
plt.figure()
dendrogram(linked)
plt.xlabel("Data Points")
plt.ylabel("Distance")
plt.title("Hierarchical Clustering Dendrogram")
plt.show()

Output

A dendrogram graph showing hierarchical merging of data points.

Result

Thus, Hierarchical Clustering was successfully implemented and the relationships between data points were visualized using a dendrogram.
